# 3D Animation and Website Design Project

This project is a demonstration of a web page using 3D animation, created with Three.js and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The page is based on interactive 3D object animations and design, combining modern animation technologies with visual elements.

## Project Description

This project is a demonstration of a web page using **3D animation**, created with **Three.js** and **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform). The page is based on interactive 3D object animations and design, combining modern animation technologies with visual elements.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** (for creating and rendering 3D graphics)
- **GSAP** (for animation and interactive effects)

## Run the project:

You can open `index.html` in your browser or launch a local server to view the page.

For example, using **Live Server** in VS Code or any other web development tool.

## Project Features

- **3D Object Animation**: The project uses **Three.js** to create and render a 3D model of a bee, which is animated to fly across the page.
- **Realistic Flower Design**: Visual elements of flowers are symmetrically placed to give an aesthetic look to the page.
- **Mirrored Text Effect**: CSS is used to create a mirror reflection effect for the "3D Animation" and "Website Design" text.
- **Interactive Elements**: **GSAP** is used for smooth animation and user interaction.
